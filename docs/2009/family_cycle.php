  <h2>Family Cycle</h2>
  <p>

On the Saturday, we will be calling on everyone to get oil up those chains and tighten up those breaks and get those old bikes out of the shed and on to the streets of Tralee. This cycle will be fully supervised, and will have a 'Cycle Garda' Escort. Fancy dress and bright colours are welcome!<br /><br />
We will be meeting up at <strong>3 pm</strong> at the <strong>Ashe Memorial Hall</strong>.
