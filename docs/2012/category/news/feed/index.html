				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><img class="alignnone" title="Walk the Line Tralee Fenit cycleway" src="http://traleetofenitcycleway.files.wordpress.com/2011/10/walk_the_line_poster_web.jpg?w=500&amp;h=353" alt="Walk the Line Tralee Fenit cycleway" width="500" height="353" /></p>
<p>The conversion of the old Tralee to Fenit rail line into a trail for walkers and cyclists has been mooted many times in the past. It has been specifically  identified  by both Tralee Town Council [ in the Town Transport plan, and LUTS report] and Kerry county council [in the County development plans]</p>
<p>Things moved forward a bit in 2009 when funding was granted to Spa/Fenit Community Council to completed the Fenit to the Spa section, Kerry County Council then decided to back the project by assisting with the remaining section of the line to Tralee.</p>
<p>Work initially started on the project but has since stopped, and there are now fear that the project will, if you excuse the pun, become derailed.</p>
<p>Recently  a number residents from along the route, Fenit, Spa and Tralee have come together to promote the project, under the Banner Friends of the <strong>Tralee/Fenit Pathway. </strong></p>
<p>They are calling on all supporters of the project to come out on Sunday 23rd Oct. to walk the Rock Street to Mounthawk section of the line.</p>
<p>Every year during the Bicycle Festival we cycle to Fenit, hopefully for next years festival we will be able to do it on the old railway</p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://traleetofenitcycleway.wordpress.com/2011/10/17/walk-the-line/">Tralee-Fenit cycleway website</a> for more information.</p>

<p>The Festival will be launched on <strong>Saturday 23rd</strong> of <strong>April</strong> at <strong>5 pm</strong> in <strong>Roundy&#8217;s Bar</strong>, Tralee by <strong>Arthur Spring and Jimmy Deenihan</strong>. We would love to see as many people there to support the festival, enjoy a cuppa and celebrate the simple joy of the bicycle.</p>
<p>There is a link for each festival event above and a full overview of the  programme is available by clicking the PROGRAMME button to the left.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a little snippet from our brochure below which will be distributed early next week.</p>
<p>DID YOU KNOW &#8230;<br />
&#8230; that outside of Dublin and Galway, Tralee has the highest percentage of commuter cyclists in the country. Not only is it safe, healthy, and sustainable, but it’s also great fun, and that’s why the Kerry Bicycle Festival came about.</p>
<p>Come along to the Kerry Bicycle Festival launch and <strong>exhibition at 6.30 pm, Friday, May 6th at Siamsa Tire</strong> and take a peek at what’s going on.  We would also love to see cyclists of all ages and abilities saddle up for the <strong>BIG CYCLE on Saturday, May 7th at 3 pm</strong>.</p>
<p>Tralee has the potential to become a more cycle-friendly town. To find out more or get involved, come along to the <strong>Transition Town Cycle Advocacy </strong>talk at the Carlton Hotel on <strong>Thursday the 28th April at 8pm.</strong></p>
