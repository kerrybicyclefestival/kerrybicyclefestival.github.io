				<content:encoded><![CDATA[Due to the success of the 2012 Dawn Cycle, we’ve decided to launch the
festival with this literally eye-opening event. Come join us as the sun comes
up, and your stress levels go down. If you do, you’ll be part of the first Mobility
week event in the whole of Europe!

This will be a leisurely cycle to welcome in both the day and the festival, with a stop for a refuel (a complimentary cuppa and
a croissant) before heading back into town. We promise to have you back in time for work, school or bed!

We will be visiting the location of the fascinating ceremonial avenue at Ballingowan which was discovered during the archaeological excavationsas part of the construction of the new N22 Tralee Bypass.
The avenue which may have been used for pagan rituals in times gone. Lucky for us, around the September 16th the Sun, Moon and Mercury all break the horizon at this point.

&nbsp;
<blockquote>&#8230;the avenue may have aligned on a celestial body at a significant time of the year. For instance the sun rises along the centre line of the avenue on the 21<sup>st</sup> March and in September the Sun, Moon and Mercury all break the horizon at this point around the 16<sup>th</sup>day of the month

&nbsp;

<strong>&#8211; Rubicon Heritage</strong></blockquote>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[So much culture, so little time! 

There are dozens of events going on in Tralee
on Culture Night. With so many events in so many venues, the bicycle proves
the perfect partner in crime, letting you nip about town and sample the best
Tralee has to offer &#8211; a Japanese acrobat, a stained glass census, a little bit of
trad&#8230; 

This cycle will visit a number of different event, venues and happenings especially selected by the organisers of <a href="http://www.culturekerry.com/" target="_blank">Culture Night</a>, after which you are free to explore on your own.


Who knows where the night will lead us?


The Culture Night programme for Kerry is available to <a href="http://www.culturekerry.com/Finalised%20Event%20Listings%20brochure%202%20K.pdf" target="_blank">download here</a>.

Hijinks to follow in the Square after.

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[A free David o’Doherty gig, what&#8217;s the catch ? 
<br/><br/>
There&#8217;s none, well you have to cycle but it is car free day after all, so we are saving you a walk !
<br/><br/>
Award-winning comedian and bicycle fiend, David
O’Doherty, has agreed to put on a secret show as
the closing event of the Festival.
A one-off event that should give rise to great silliness
and a good dose of the giggles.
This is a free gig but you will have to cycle to find out
the secret location. This cycle will be lead by David
himself. Rumours of an all-in-one lycra body-suit are
false(ish).
<br/><br/>
If you cannot cycle for any reason (and it
better be good) contact info@kerrybicyclefestival.github.io
to make alternative arrangements.
David Nicholas O’Doherty is a Perrier
Award winning Irish comedian,
author, musician, actor, playwright
&#8230;and bike nut.
<br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
<strong>Note</strong>: It will probably be dusk by the time this show, so don&#8217;t forget your lights.]]></content:encoded>
