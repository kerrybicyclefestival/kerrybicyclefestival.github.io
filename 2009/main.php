 Have a rummage in the shed and pull out that Triumph 20, because we need you for the <a href="index.php?p=family_cycle">Family Cycle.</a><br /></p>

<p>The Kerry Bicycle Festival is taking place from the 7th to the 16th of May. During this time we will have range bicycle activities lined up. On the Saturday we are inviting everyone to pull those bikes out of the sheds as we take to the streets of Tralee for a Family Cycle. For those of you who feel a bit more energetic you can take part in the sponsored cycle to Castleisland. On the Sunday we're going to cycle to Fenit for a picnic. </p>
