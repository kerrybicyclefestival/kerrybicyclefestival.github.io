				<content:encoded><![CDATA[So much culture, so little time! 

There are dozens of events going on in Tralee
on Culture Night. With so many events in so many venues, the bicycle proves
the perfect partner in crime, letting you nip about town and sample the best
Tralee has to offer &#8211; a Japanese acrobat, a stained glass census, a little bit of
trad&#8230; 

This cycle will visit a number of different event, venues and happenings especially selected by the organisers of <a href="http://www.culturekerry.com/" target="_blank">Culture Night</a>, after which you are free to explore on your own.


Who knows where the night will lead us?
