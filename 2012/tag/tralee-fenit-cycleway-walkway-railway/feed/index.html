<p>The conversion of the old Tralee to Fenit rail line into a trail for walkers and cyclists has been mooted many times in the past. It has been specifically  identified  by both Tralee Town Council [ in the Town Transport plan, and LUTS report] and Kerry county council [in the County development plans]</p>
<p>Things moved forward a bit in 2009 when funding was granted to Spa/Fenit Community Council to completed the Fenit to the Spa section, Kerry County Council then decided to back the project by assisting with the remaining section of the line to Tralee.</p>
<p>Work initially started on the project but has since stopped, and there are now fear that the project will, if you excuse the pun, become derailed.</p>
<p>Recently  a number residents from along the route, Fenit, Spa and Tralee have come together to promote the project, under the Banner Friends of the <strong>Tralee/Fenit Pathway. </strong></p>
<p>They are calling on all supporters of the project to come out on Sunday 23rd Oct. to walk the Rock Street to Mounthawk section of the line.</p>
<p>Every year during the Bicycle Festival we cycle to Fenit, hopefully for next years festival we will be able to do it on the old railway</p>
