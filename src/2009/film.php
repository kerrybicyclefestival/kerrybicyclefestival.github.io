Hello there.<br />
We are currenty seeking submissions of short films as part of the festival. The films must feature cycling on some level (tricylces, unicyles, and tandems are all acceptable) or be in some way bike related.
In addition to these films, the programme will also feature selected films which debuted at the <a href="http://dublinbicyclefestival.org" target="_blank">Dublin Bicycle Festival</a> in 2006. 
<br />
The festival film night will take place in the <a href="http://samhlaiocht.com" target="_blank">Samhlaiocht</a> gallery on Friday the 18th.
<br />
The deadline for entries is the 10th of April. All entries must be under 15 minutes. Keep 'em short, and submit them on DVD to Michael Kelly, Rooftop, Tom Creen Business Centre, Kerry Technology Park, Tralee, County Kerry. Alternatively, if you have it up on line you can email relevant links to <a href="mailto:film@kerrybicyclefestival.org">film@kerrybicyclefestival.org</a><br /> 
On yer bike!
